On June 3, 2014, members of the Polish Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (PPEA) met to celebrate the award of „Private Equity Diamonds” for the year 2013 with a gala evening in Warsaw. We are pleased to announce that on this event Jacek Korpala, Managing Partner of ARX, was named as Private Equity Personality of the year 2013 in Poland. The ceremony was the culmination of the V edition of Private Equity Forum – a conference, which every year brings together the leaders of the sector in Poland. We are especially proud of the fact that Jacek’s contribution to the development of the industry were recognized by the Chapter composed of PE investors and professionals focused on the sector under the leadership of the Director of the Polish Private Equity & Venture Capital Association.
