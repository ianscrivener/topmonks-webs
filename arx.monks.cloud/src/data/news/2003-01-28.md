DBG Eastern Europe’s second Central and Eastern European-focused private equity fund has completed a first closing at € 67 M. The fund’s second close will be completed later in the year, with targeted total commitments of € 80 M. DBG Eastern Europe II LP is the successor fund to the highly successful DBG Osteuropa-Holding GmbH, which has already returned nearly four times its original investor commitments. The first close of DBG Eastern Europe II LP has been completed with the unanimous backing of the predecessor fund’s limited partners: Deutsche Bank, EBRD, Mitsubishi Corporation and DEG.

The Central and Eastern European-focused private equity firm was established in 1996 with the support of German middle market buy-out firm, Deutsche Beteiligungs AG. The firm’s partners will maintain their relationship with Deutsche Beteiligungs AG, while operating from an established network of offices in Budapest, Prague and Warsaw.

DBG Eastern Europe’s strategy remains consistent, with a focus on later stage investments such as expansion financing, management buy-outs and buy-ins and industry consolidation transactions. The fund will primarily target the core EU accession countries of Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, with a secondary focus on Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Eastern Europe and the Baltic Republics.
