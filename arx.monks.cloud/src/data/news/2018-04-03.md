Following an approval by regulatory authorities, ARX Equity Partners (ARX) has completed the exit of its investment in Czech producer of specialized electrical motors VUES Brno s.r.o. (VUES) via a sale to Moog Inc. (NYSE:MOG.A) (NYSE:MOG.B) for a purchase price of € 53 million. The ARX investment into VUES generated an overall 11.8x cash-on-cash return multiple and an IRR of over 30%.



ARX acquired a majority shareholding in VUES from retiring managers in 2006, with the intention to leverage the company’s inherent technical strengths and capabilities in order to grow and further internationalize the business. Over the past eight years VUES expanded its profit margins considerably, while simultaneously doubling sales and increasing headcount by over 30%.
