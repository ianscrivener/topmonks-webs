The transaction strengthens Swiss Life’s presence in this region and Swiss Life together with Fincentrum as a leading financial adviser in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Swiss Life acquires Fincentrum, an independent financial advisor founded in 2000 with more than 2,500 financial advisors and a turnover exceeding CZK 1.6 bn that is located in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Swiss Life Group is a leading comprehensive life and pensions and financial solutions provider across Europe. The offering of high-quality financial services for over 160 years has built an excellent reputation and a continuously strong financial standing. 

This acquisition strengthens Swiss Life’s presence in the region and positions the company as a market leader for independent financial advice in Czech Republic and Slovakia.

To ensure stability and sustainable continuation of both service offerings, Swiss Life Select and Fincentrum will retain their independent brand and sales leadership structure.

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Both parties have agreed not to disclose the purchase price.
