Funds managed by Arx Equity Partners (“ARX”) supported Tomplast d.o.o., a Slovenian plastic components producer, to perform an add-on acquisition of Unitplast d.o.o..

On April 25, 2008, Tomplast, backed by ARX, completed the add-on acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in Unitplast. ARX has held a controlling stake in Tomplast since July 2007, when the company was acquired in partnership with Mr. Mark Stemberger in a management buy-in transaction.

Tomplast is a Slovenian manufacturing company, which acts primarily as a tier two supplier of plastic components for the automotive and leisure industries.

Unitplast is a producer of rubber and plastic components located in Semič, Slovenia. On a pro-forma basis the acquisition of Unitplast will more than double Tomplast’s 2008 revenues.
