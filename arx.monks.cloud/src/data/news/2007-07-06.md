Slovenian plastic components producer, Tomplast d.o.o., has been acquired by DBG Eastern Europe II, LP (“DBG”). Tomplast is one of Slovenia’s leading manufacturers of plastic-moulded components.

On July 6, 2007, DBG completed an MBI of a 100% shareholding in Tomplast d.o.o. The acquisition of Tomplast is DBG’s second Slovenian manufacturing buy-out investment in the past two years.

Tomplast is a Slovenian manufacturing company, with a primary strategic focus as a supplier of plastic components mainly to the automotive industry. The MBI team that has partnered with DBG in the Tomplast acquisition is led by Mark Stemberger. DBG and Mr. Stemberger intend to grow Tomplast in the coming years organically and potentially via acquisitions. The transaction size was not disclosed.
