DC Bled has acquired the largest private healthcare provider in the Maribor area, Fontana (Medicinsko Termalni Center Fontana zdravstvo in rekreacija, d.o.o.) in March 2019, making DC Bled by far the largest private out-patient healthcare provider in Slovenia. Also, in January this year, DC Bled opened its new modern health center in Novo Mesto. These developments follow two clinic acquisitions completed in 2018. DC Bled now covers the entire country with its six clinics, over 100 employees, while serving more than 20,000 patients per annum. The company is planning additional acquisitions in 2019, led by its senior management team Lenca Moze (CFO) and Zvone Novina (CEO). All of these developments are aligned with DC Bled’s core objective to provide the highest quality medical care and service to its growing network of patients.
