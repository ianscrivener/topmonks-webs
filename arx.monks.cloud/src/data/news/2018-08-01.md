DC Bled has completed the acquisition of diagnostics center Gastromedica in May 2018, located in Murska Sobota. This comes two years after the acquisition of Medi Cons based in Novo Mesto, Slovenia. Later this year DC Bled will consolidate its Kostanevica location with Medi Cons in a modern health center in downtown Novo Mesto. Gastromedica specializes in endoscopy procedures for chronical diseases and performs more than 2,000 procedures a year. Its medical team, including the founder Dr. Puc remain. Despite the slow execution of a broader market consolidation buy-and-build strategy, DC Bled hopes to acquire 2-3 additional clinics by the end of 2018.
