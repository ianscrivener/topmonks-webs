        <h3 class="h3_left-align">Leave your business challenges up to the Monks</h3>
        <p>Starting out with just an Excel spreadsheet and his tremendous experience in
          the travel industry, founder David Manley’s&nbsp;personal and customized approach
          got his business taking off faster than any normal spreadsheet could handle. As
          his customers increased, unfortunately scalability did not. So TopMonks
          fixed&nbsp;it.</p>
        <h3 class="h3_left-align">Now GRE travels with automation</h3>
        <p>With every destination they offer, GRE becomes an expert by combining local
          knowledge with their own first-hand experiences. This ultimate combo of tips,
          hacks and travel wizardry is then inputted into a uniquely structured database,
          enabling GRE’s&nbsp;proprietary algorithm to instantly create a perfect and
          customizable itinerary for anyone. Travelers can sit back, relax, and spend
          their time the way they want. No matter how complex a trip may seem, GRE masters
          the art of giving a seamless experience.</p></div>

          bigger, they needed more space. With that said, TopMonks helped raise $200K to
          make it happen. As we speak, GRE is raising an additional $1.5M to expand around

          one who’s&nbsp;teamed up with another dev from GRE’s&nbsp;side. The MVP went from
          Ruby 3.2&nbsp;to 5.2, where it’s&nbsp;currently still running. But with a lot of
          growth comes a lot of future plans, and GRE has already partnered with Prague
          Startup SmartGuide to integrate its catchy mobile travel app into
          GRE’s&nbsp;itineraries.</p>
